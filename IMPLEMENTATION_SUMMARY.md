## How to Use

### Running Migrations

1. Make sure your Supabase instance is running:
   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```

2. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

   Or if using remote Supabase:
   ```bash
   supabase db push --linked
   ```

### Using Deal Interactions

1. Open any deal from the Deals page
2. Click the "Interactions" tab
3. Fill in the interaction form at the top
4. View all interactions in the timeline below
5. Click "Dashboard" tab to see metrics

### Using Reminders

1. **From a Deal:**
   - Open any deal
   - Click "Set Reminder" button next to Edit/Archive
   - Fill in the reminder form and save

2. **From Reminders Page:**
   - Click "Reminders" in the main navigation
   - Click "New Reminder" button
   - View upcoming/completed reminders in tabs

## Technical Notes

- All components follow existing patterns from `notes` and `tasks`
- Attachments use the existing Supabase `attachments` bucket
- No external dependencies added (uses existing shadcn/ui components)
- TypeScript types added to `src/atomic-crm/types.ts`
- Data provider callbacks handle file uploads automatically
- All dates are in UTC+0 as per user requirements

## What's NOT Included (Intentionally Kept Simple)

- No real-time notifications (would require additional infrastructure)
- No recurring reminders (structure is there, but not implemented in UI)
- No charts/graphs in dashboard (text-based metrics only)
- No email/push notifications (in-app only)
- No advanced filtering on interactions list (basic view only)
